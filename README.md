# Minus Interpreter
An interpreter for Minus, a minimalist programming language (unrelated to [this](http://www.golfscript.com/minus/) Minus).

This interpreter is still a work in progress. See `language.md` for a description of Minus. Not all features listed there have been implemented in the interpreter yet - specifically, `^`, `:`, and `|` do not fully work, and most of the preprocessor features are missing.
