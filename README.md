# Minus Interpreter
An interpreter for Minus, a minimalist programming language (unrelated to [this](http://www.golfscript.com/minus/) Minus).

See `language.md` for a description of the language and syntax. Also look in the `examples` folder for Minus examples. These examples use the Minus standard libraries (in the `libraries`) folder, which define much of the basic syntax, including `if` statements and function definitions. Look at the examples for how to use these.

`make` compiles the interpreter, with the name `minus`, into the working directory. To run Minus with a file, use `./minus path/to/file`.
